# SCT_DS_3
# DESCRIPTION 
For this project, I used the Bank Marketing Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which is widely used for classification problems.

# Objectives

Preprocess and clean the dataset (handle missing values, encode categorical data, normalize features).

Build a Decision Tree Classifier model.

Train the model to predict whether a customer subscribes to a term deposit.

Evaluate the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Visualize the decision tree for better interpretability.


# Key Outcomes

Identified the most important features influencing customer decisions (e.g., age, job type, marital status, duration of contact).

Built an interpretable decision tree model for marketing predictions.

Demonstrated the use of classification algorithms in solving real-world business problems.


This task highlights the application of machine learning in marketing analytics and shows how decision trees can support business decision-making.
