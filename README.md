# SCT_DS_3
# DESCRIPTION 
For this project, I used the Bank Marketing Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which is widely used for classification problems.

# Objectives

Preprocess and clean the dataset (handle missing values, encode categorical data, normalize features).

Build a Decision Tree Classifier model.

Train the model to predict whether a customer subscribes to a term deposit.

Evaluate the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Visualize the decision tree for better interpretability.

# KPIs for Task 03: Decision Tree Classifier

1. Accuracy – Overall percentage of correctly classified predictions (both purchase and non-purchase).
2. Precision – Out of all customers predicted as likely to purchase, how many actually purchased (focus on reducing false positives).
3. Recall (Sensitivity) – Out of all customers who actually purchased, how many were correctly identified (focus on reducing false negatives).
4. F1-Score – Harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between the two.
5. Confusion Matrix – Breakdown of True Positives, True Negatives, False Positives, and False Negatives.
6. ROC-AUC Score – Ability of the classifier to distinguish between customers who purchase and those who don’t.
7. Feature Importance – Identifying which demographic and behavioral attributes (e.g., age, job, campaign contacts, duration) most influence the purchase decision.
8. Model Interpretability – Ability to visualize and explain decision tree splits for business understanding.


# FINAL CONCLUSION
In this task, I built a Decision Tree Classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service using the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset included demographic and behavioral attributes such as age, job, marital status, education, previous marketing outcomes, and campaign details.

# Key Findings

The decision tree model was able to classify customer purchase behavior with good accuracy.

Features such as previous campaign outcome, contact method, and duration of last contact played a major role in predicting customer decisions.

Demographic factors like age group and job type also influenced the probability of purchase.


 # Key Takeaway

This project demonstrates how decision tree models can be applied to real-world marketing data to predict customer behavior. The analysis highlights the importance of both demographics and past interactions in determining whether a customer is likely to subscribe to a product or service.

# Key Outcomes

Identified the most important features influencing customer decisions (e.g., age, job type, marital status, duration of contact).

Built an interpretable decision tree model for marketing predictions.

Demonstrated the use of classification algorithms in solving real-world business problems.


## This task highlights the application of machine learning in marketing analytics and shows how decision trees can support business decision-making.
